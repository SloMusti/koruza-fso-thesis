My research is aimed to significantly improve the state of free-space optical technology for use in urban environments and last-mile access networks. The effort ranges from technical innovation, preproduction of developed solutions and creation of use-cases and performance and reliability studies useful to telecommunication professionals, such that they can quickly adopt free-space networking and provide a better service to their customers. The primary goal is to develop wireless optical system KORUZA http://koruza.net sufficiently to become a model solutions, its open hardware and open source approach boost the overall innovation in this field.
